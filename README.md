One Button. 30 Levels. 5 Seconds Each.
Think fast. Or lose.

5 Seconds is a psychological reflex + logic game built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Every level presents a single rule inside a circular button.
You have only 5 seconds to decide whether to press it or not.

Press only if the condition is true.
One mistake — and it's game over.

🧠 Game Concept

30 progressively harder levels

Each level has a unique logical, mathematical, psychological, or pattern-based condition

5-second decision timer

One-button gameplay

Increasing tension from Level 1 to Level 30

The background gradually transitions from green (safe) to deep red (danger) as you progress — intensifying psychological pressure.

🎯 Core Mechanics

✔ Press if condition is TRUE
✔ Don’t press if condition is FALSE
✔ No action within 5 seconds = “No Press”
✔ One wrong decision ends the run
